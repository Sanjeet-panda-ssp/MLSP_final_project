# MLSP_final_project
Repository for the final project for E9 205 Machine Learning for Signal Processing course.
Goal: Building a Machine Learning model that can predict head tilt from images. 

- Authors: Souvadra Hati, Sanjeet Swaroop Panda 

Ground rules: 
- Always, work in your own branch, so that you don't break something in the other's code. 
- Commit your work as often as possible. Every commit of yours is stored as a memory stamp in Git, hence your work can never be lost.
- Make as many separate files for different programs as possible, keeps the codes small and cleaner
- Always comment stuff out so that other partner can read your code too. 
- In the ReadMe file, always add a 2-3 line explaination of your every file you create (specially helper files, that the other person can import in his code"
- Merge your codes to the main file when you know that they are working properly and can be integrated together. 
- Use .py files over .ipynb files for the developmental process, makes debugging and stuff lot more easier in a Git scenario. Plus, using Jupyter notebook for production purpose is a bad job

Lots of more blah blah blahs about this project
